# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
This project aims to analyze Walmart sales data to identify top-performing branches and products, understand sales trends across different product categories, and examine customer behavior. The objective is to explore opportunities for improving and optimizing sales strategies. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

**Data Overview:**
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. It comprises sales transactions from three different branches of Walmart located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The dataset contains 17 columns and 1000 rows, covering various aspects such as invoice details, branch information, customer demographics, product details, pricing, taxes, and more.

**Analysis List:**

Product Analysis:

This analysis focuses on understanding the different product lines, identifying top-performing product lines, and determining areas for improvement within the product offerings.

**Approach Used:
**
Data Wrangling:
The first step involves inspecting the data to identify and handle missing or NULL values. Data replacement methods are used where necessary to ensure data integrity.

Database Creation:
A database is built, tables are created, and data is inserted to facilitate further analysis.

Feature Engineering:
New columns are generated from existing ones to provide additional insights. For example, the "time_of_day" column categorizes sales into morning, afternoon, and evening, while the "day_name" column extracts the day of the week for each transaction.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is conducted to address the project objectives and questions outlined earlier. Visualizations and statistical analyses are utilized to gain insights into the data and answer key questions.
